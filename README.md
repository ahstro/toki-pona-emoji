# toki-pona-emoji
**a proposed translation of toki pona lexicon into github emoji**

I thought it would be interesting to select a subset of the emoticons listed on [emoji-cheat-sheet.com](http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com) (https://github.com/arvida/emoji-cheat-sheet.com) and use them as an alternate visual language for [toki pona](http://tokipona.net/tp/ClassicWordList.aspx).

See [word_list.org](https://github.com/holtzermann17/toki-pona-emoji/blob/master/word_list.org) for the emoji rendition of the classic word list and [sample_phrases.org](https://github.com/holtzermann17/toki-pona-emoji/blob/master/sample_phrases.org) for the emoji rendition of [these basic phrases](http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/tokipona.htm).

## What's next

Perhaps a rendition of [these phrases](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/text/zompist.html)... beginning with:

> :beetle: :small_red_triangle: :ok_woman: :stew: :point_left: ~~ _pipi li lon moku mi_ (Waiter, there's a fly in my soup.)

But perhaps more importantly, some code (which I have already written and need to dust off) for input.  Bonus points for me if I manage to get one of the [formal grammars](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~chin/661F12/Projects/ztomaszewski.pdf) implemented along with the input method.
