# toki-pona-emoji
**a proposed translation of toki pona lexicon into github emoji**

I thought it would be interesting to select a subset of the emoticons listed on *[emoji-cheat-sheet.com](http://emoji-cheat-sheet.com)* and use them as an alternate visual language for *[toki pona](http://rowa.giso.de/languages/toki-pona/english/toki-pona-lessons.pdf)*.

_See [word_list.md](https://github.com/holtzermann17/toki-pona-emoji/blob/master/word_list.md) for the emoji rendition of the [classic word list](http://tokipona.net/tp/ClassicWordList.aspx) and [sample_phrases.md](https://github.com/holtzermann17/toki-pona-emoji/blob/master/sample_phrases.md) for the emoji rendition of [these basic phrases](http://www.omniglot.com/language/phrases/tokipona.htm)._

The emoji are active on Github and other places.  Suggestions about alternative treatments are most welcome!

## What's next

1. Perhaps a rendition of [these phrases](http://tokipona.net/tp/janpije/text/zompist.html)... beginning with:

>>> :beetle: :small_red_triangle: :bow: :stew: :point_left:

>>_pipi li lon moku mi_

> (Waiter, there's a fly in my soup.)

2. But perhaps more importantly, some code (which I have already written and need to dust off) for input.  Bonus points for me if I manage to get one of the [formal grammars](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~chin/661F12/Projects/ztomaszewski.pdf) implemented along with the input method.
